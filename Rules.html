</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">&nbsp;Keeping in mind the growing crime rate against teenagers, especially girls, we have generated a few under mentioned guidelines that students must follow in their daily lives: &nbsp;</span><br></p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">&nbsp;1. Students will not open facebook account before the age of sixteen. If it is found that any student has a facebook account, strict action will be taken against him/her by the school. &nbsp;</span></p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">&nbsp;2. Students must not divulge their phone numbers or e-mail ids to strangers, nor should they accept any friend request from them on facebook or any other social networking site. &nbsp;</span></p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">&nbsp;3. Students must be accompanied by their parents till the school gate in all school functions and carnivals. &nbsp;</span></p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">&nbsp;4. If for some reason, any student has to stay alone, he/she must not reveal about it to anyone except the class teacher/school authorities. &nbsp;</span></p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">&nbsp;5. Students MUST NOT accept a lift in the vehicle of any stranger. Be firm but courteous in saying 'NO' to them. &nbsp;</span></p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">&nbsp;6. Students coming for extra-classes or staying back after school must inform their parents/guardians about the timings and should go home accompanied by some one. It is advisable that you go to your home directly after tuition classes instead of going to some other place. &nbsp;</span></p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">&nbsp;7. In case any student finds that the driver or conductor of the school/private transport is inappropriately dressed, he/she must report it to the class teacher or the school Principal. &nbsp;</span></p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">&nbsp;8. Students must not tolerate the indecent or abusive language used, either from the driver or the conductor. Such behaviour must be brought to the notice of the school Principal. They should help in the smooth functioning of the school by informing the school about any kind of indecent behaviour by them in the school/private bus or any other place where they are present.&nbsp;</span></p></div>
